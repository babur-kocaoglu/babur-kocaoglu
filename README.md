## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**babur-kocaoglu/babur-kocaoglu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on heterogenous agent models with sequence space jacobians, Bayesian Econometrics, and DSGE models.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the literature behind HANK models on the macro side and long run restrictions on the time series side.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Time Series Econometrics.
- âš¡ Fun fact:  I'm a niche fragrance hobbyist. I would like to create my own fragrances in the future. Here is my current collection: https://www.fragrantica.com/member/1962025
